			Morning craft sessions offer writers a chance to talk with faculty and writers in residence about varied topics of interest, writers’ lives, books, and matters of craft including techniques, themes, and forms. On alternating mornings, the Juniper community gathers for moderated Q&amp;As with the previous night’s readers. Together, craft sessions and Q&amp;As give Juniper participants numerous opportunities to engage with the Institute's distinguished faculty and writers in residence.

			<accordion-group heading="Surface Tensions with Jensen Beach">
			<p style="text-align:left">	In this session we'll look at some of the ways in which fiction writers generate effective narrative energy in a story's subtext. A lot of good fiction achieves its lasting effect, its artfulness, through what is not obviously present on the surface, what lurks just underneath the series of events and actions that make up the story's plot. Often this subtext is unnamed and unnameable, complicated, made up as it is, of a complex web of the characters' desires and fears. We'll read excerpts by Tove Jansson, NoViolet Bulawayo, Peter Stamm, and others. And we'll engage in some guided activities designed to illustrate the power of what is just beneath the surface of a good story.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="Transport: Making Movement on the Page with Jack Christian">
			<p style="text-align:left">Richard Hugo famously instructed his students to “write off the subject.” But, where to go and how to get there? How to meander meaningfully? How to write with all the mystery and cheer of a good walk? In this session, we’ll examine poetry and prose that gets off its subject and explores surprising unknowns. We’ll talk elliptical poetics and poetries of motion. We’ll look at monologues and scenes that affect the foot’s or the mind’s particular pace. In so doing, we’ll attempt to uncover various syntaxes of movement that we might appreciate, aspire to, practice. Ultimately, we’ll hope that our focus on movement will deliver us toward our more highfalutin desires to say the unsayable, or to render electric consciousness.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="GET OUT OF MY WALLED-IN INFINITY with Heather Christle">
			    <p style="text-align:left">After a long day or life of heaving through space in a body, it can be a relief to move to the open, less bounded realm of the page. This is a craft session for poets and writers who are weary of the laws of the material world and curious about leaping into physically impossible spaces, the sorts of spaces that can only exist in language. We'll look at myths and jokes, poems and stories, looking to see how and where and why they break the rules of the world we inhabit. We'll watch as words make time collapse and objects expand, and then we will perform those feats ourselves.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="Limited Possibilities: Constraints as Generative with Christy Crutchfield">
			<p style="text-align:left">TWe often think of the creative process as an unbound one, no rules as we tromp all over the page. But can limiting our options produce new possibilities?  Can rules force us to be creative? While constraints sound, well, constraining, they can also challenge our habits and refresh our writing process. In this craft session we will examine traditional and original forms in poetry and prose, create our own constraints, and use the discussion to generate new work.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="(Re)orientation with Chris Dombrowski">
			    <p style="text-align:left">In this session, we will explore multiple ways to reacquaint ourselves with our own writing that’s been left untended for a while. Most of us have, for one reason or another, let a body of work lie fallow for long enough that upon return the piece seemed penned by another person (and perhaps, in some ways, was). Short of ingesting our old drafts, how do we re-engage significantly with work we feel compelled to "finish"? Citing examples from Czeslaw Milosz, Flannery O'Connor, Italo Calvino, and others, we will explore practical, hands-on methods of re-engagement, re-enlightenment, and reparation. (Participants are encouraged but not required to bring a long-filed-away draft of a poem, essay, or fiction to the session).</p>

			<accordion-group heading="Mono no Aware: The Fleeting Beauty of Things with Lauren Foss Goodman">
			<p style="text-align:left">The longer you look at one object,the more of the world you see in it. ~Flannery O’Connor</p>
			<p style="text-align:left">The Japanese expression 物の哀れ or もののあわれ or <em>mono no aware</em> is sometimes translated as “the poignant beauty of things” or “an empathy toward things” or “the pity of things” or “a sensitivity to ephemera.”  It is a way of seeing, a form of beauty, that is about transience - of objects, seasons, people and places,and a phrase we have yet to discover in English. Mono no aware embodies the sad radiance of the cherry blossoms that open for a week and then are gone; it is the bittersweet feel of the beginning of autumn, the sad loveliness of a warm Sunday evening. In this craft session, we will explore the concept of mono no aware and look for it in the art and literature we cherish, and in the work that we create. We’ll focus on the transience of things that move us, deeply, but that we may or may not yet have found the words for. Come prepared to look, write, discuss, and to find your own transient translation for <em>mono no aware</em>. </p>

			<accordion-group heading="Idea Machine with Amelia Gray">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Writing is about making connections. Whether you’re linking experience with observation, past with future, or general culture versus your specific life, all stories have these connective fibers. Let’s play with ideas over the course of an hour, exploring in the process how different minds make different connections. You should leave the session with a mindfulness about how stories are made, along with some practical tools you can use to push through writers’ block and get the machine running on your next story. </p>

			<accordion-group heading="What’s the point of Point of View? with Noy Holland">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Ideas of audience and point of view can often feel mechanical and limiting. How can we enlarge our sense of the possibilities of point of view? Are there implicit and explicit variations?  Might there be a listener as well as an audience, different from a reader, and perhaps more intimately known? What nuanced forms might a listener inhabit? To whom are we speaking, and why? </p>

			<accordion-group heading="The Poetry of Prose with Mitchell S. Jackson">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Baudelaire said, “always be a poet, even in prose.” If we consider sentences that strike us and what makes them memorable, more often than not they reveal a writer’s command of devices most commonly associated with poetry. We will read aloud and critique passages from especially poetic prose writers with the goal of unpacking the poetics—alliteration, assonance, list making, repetition, anaphora, neologism, portmanteau, etc.—and the use in crafting sentences that are, among other attributes, vivid, energized, acoustically engaging, and imaginative. We will discuss passages from writers including John Edgar Wideman, Denis Johnson, Barry Hannah, Christine Schutt, and Joan Didion. We will also use descriptive passages from other writers as source material upon which to apply the techniques discussed during the session.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="The Lyric Essay with Paul Lisicky">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Part poem, part nonfiction narrative, part song: a lyric essay lives on the borders. It talks to the poem in its fidelity to compression, sound, and image. It talks to the essay in its work of idiosyncratic meditation. What does it mean to test, to try? We'll look at some short examples of the form as a way into wondering about voice and structure. We'll also get started on a lyric essay inspired by the work in front of us. </p>

		<accordion close-others="oneAtATime" >
			<accordion-group heading="LISTS with Emily Pettit">
			    <p style="text-align:left">According to Merriam Webster Dictionary the word list is defined in some of the following ways:  1. desire 2. listen 3. a band or strip of material 4. to tilt to one side 5. a simple series of words or numerals. There is not room here to list all the varying definitions of the word list. That list once meant desire makes a great deal of sense because we so often desire lists. We want lists and lists are everywhere. Lists are employed in all forms of writing and are capable of leading us to many marvelous places. We will look at poetic lists, pragmatic lists, visual lists, sonic lists, and more. Lists provide ways to lean into the ineffable chaos and connect with it. We will look at different kinds of lists and let them help us to get in touch with new ways of linking ideas, language, and meaning together.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="Do Be So Naïve with Zachary Schomburg">
			    <p style="text-align:left">I've heard many poets suggest that we should write what we know. How bizarre! What is it we think we know anyway? Poets can be so naive, and that's the good news. In this craft session, we'll talk about naiveté’s productive role in crafting an image, and about what it means to allow our subjects to fascinate us once we un-know them, as if each new poem births its poet into a tiny world. How does what we know or assume about a thing stymie its inherent mystery? How can we write about a thing that doesn't strip it of its strangeness? We'll put mystery into practice, then share and discuss the new poems we generate.</p>

			<accordion-group heading="This Is a Statement: A Poem Is a Question with Evie Shockley">
			    <p style="text-align:left">So many complaints and disclaimers about the writing process begin with the announcement: "I have nothing to say!" Having definitive pronouncements to make -- about ourselves or our perspectives, let alone others and the whole huge universe we are in -- can feel like a daunting task, and rightly so. There's nothing easy about self-knowledge, empathy, or wisdom of any sort. Fortunately, as poets and writers in other imaginative genres, our task is not to make pronouncements, but to ask and explore questions. How can we find, develop, and investigate good (read: rich, complex, powerful) questions in our writing? Now, there's a question we can work with!</p>

			<accordion-group heading="Rekindling Your Barbaric Yawp with Betsy Wheeler">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Has writing begun to feel more like a chore than a calling? Does it feel rote? Maybe you are writing like crazy but none of it works; maybe poem titles evade you, or you absolutely cannot reach a satisfying ending to a story or essay. Or worst of all, do you think about writing constantly but are finding it difficult to get back to the page? In this session, we’ll experiment with a few methods of surpassing seemingly insurmountable blocks to get lines and sentences flowing again. We’ll re-examine the roots of creativity, the neuroscience behind inspiration, and give ourselves permission to be pulled into new territory using the tools of meditation, yoga, and bookmaking. We’ll learn some tricks of patience and perseverance from a few master creators such as Nina Simone, Rilke, Melville, Tom Waits, Tori Amos, and Haruki Murakami. Best of all we will get curious, and see for ourselves how the simplest changes in practice can yield surprising results. </p>

			<accordion-group heading="Talking Nonsense: Doing What You Believe You Shouldn't Do with Dara Wier">
			    <p style="text-align:left">Why and when should finding cliches, making use of stereotypes, embracing melodrama, accepting hyperbole, enjoying didacticism, practicing anachronism, and other cautions be faced or perhaps stared down? When the only thing that makes sense is non-sense, for instance, how does a writer know when to send caution to the wind? When does any of this matter and since judging one's writing is typically couched in reason or rational discourse, how can a writer recognize reason's failures and rationality's mendacities? How can we improve our conversations about these things and make use of them in our writing while taking good care of our minds? Be thinking about these matters and bring with you some notes about all this to share with us.</p>
			    <p style="text-align:left">Finally, here's something for atmosphere, something to have nearby:</p>
			    <p style="text-align:left"> <i>Sometimes the house of the future is better built, lighter and larger than all the houses of the past, so that the image of the dream house is opposed to that of the childhood home…. Maybe it is a good thing for us to keep a few dreams of a house that we shall live in later, always later, so much later, in fact, that we shall not have time to achieve it. For a house that was final, one that stood in symmetrical relation to the house we were born in, would lead to thoughts—serious, sad thoughts—and not to dreams. It is better to live in a state of impermanence than in one of finality. (Gaston Bachelard, 1884-1962) THE POETICS OF SPACE, 1958)</i></p>
			    <p style="text-align:left">During the course of our brief meeting I'll be asking you to write for about 9 minutes. Write what?  Something related to all of the above.</p>
