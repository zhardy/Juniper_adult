                <p>The strength and promise of your writing sample is the most important component of your application. Send your best work; it needn’t be published, though published work is acceptable, and does not have to be the same sample you wish to present in workshop. Writing samples are comprised of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-7 pages of poetry (one poem per page) or</li>
                    <li>7-9 pages of fiction or creative nonfiction/memoir (double-spaced)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Samples should be saved in one document (doc, docx, pdf, rtf, or txt). Please include your name &amp; email address as a header or footer in the writing sample.</p>
