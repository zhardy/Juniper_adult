                <p>The strength and promise of your writing sample is the most important component of your application. Send your best work; it needn’t be published, though published work is acceptable, and does not have to be the same sample you wish to present in workshop. Writing samples are comprised of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-7 pages of poetry (one poem per page) or</li>
                    <li>7-9 pages of fiction or creative nonfiction/memoir (double-spaced)</li>
                    <li>Visual art (drawings, graphics, or pictures, etc.) are <u>optional</u> for applicants to the "words + pictures" workshop</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Samples should be saved in one document (doc, docx, pdf, rtf, or txt). Please include your name &amp; email address as a header or footer in the writing sample.</p>

                <p>Since participating at Juniper, I've found it easier to change my writing and experiment with styles.

            <p>The Institute awards five work-study* scholarships of 50% tuition remission, several sponsored scholarships in the amount of $500 (each offered by one of our wonderful literary <a target='_blank' href="http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/sponsors">scholarship sponsors</a>), and one full tuition scholarship sponsored by The Valley Advocate. We especially encourage applicants who have experienced socioeconomic disadvantage or discrimination. </p>
           
            <p>As part of the Personal Statement portion of the application, scholarship applicants should include information about their need for funding. To support a full creative life for all, Juniper offers additional support (one 100% and three 75% tuition scholarships) to individuals who have experienced socioeconomic disadvantages or discrimination, and/or who are citizens of underrepresented populations.. It is our hope that this practice helps to cultivate a just, inclusive, equitable literary community. Any details you choose to share in your statement or application will help us discern distribution of those funds.</p>
