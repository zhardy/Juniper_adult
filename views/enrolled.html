                <h3 class="header">Workshops</h3><br>
                <p>Daily writing workshops are at the heart of the Juniper Institute. Here, writers generate new work and present that work, or other work-in-progress, to their assigned faculty workshop leaders and peers. Workshop sizes are kept small so that every writer's work gets dedicated attention. In addition to focusing on specific pieces of writing, writers actively interrogate larger issues of form, style, content, language, and process.</p>
                <p>Every workshop has its own climate and conventions: some lean toward the generation of new work, some toward the honing of existing pieces, and others emphasize a combination of both. While details are subject to revision, <a href="http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/institute/workshops">click here</a> to learn more about how the 2017 faculty describe their approach to their Juniper workshops. Workshop assignments are made in early May. We will be in touch with you in mid-May with instructions concerning anything you need to send in advance or bring with you to your assigned workshop.</p>

            <section id="Craft Sessions">
                <h3 class="header">Craft Sessions and Q&amp;A's</h3><br>
                <p>Daily interactive craft sessions and Q&amp;As allow faculty and writers in residence to interact with participants and explore issues pertinent to writing and the writing life, or to lead writing exercises. Three sessions will be devoted to moderated Q&amp;As with select faculty members and writers in residence, offering rare opportunities to discuss process, inspiration, and craft with master writers. On other days, multiple craft sessions or small-group Q&amp;As will run simultaneously with faculty and writers in residence. These sessions will tackle diverse issues of craft and imagination, with an emphasis on guided writing exercises to generate new material. In the spring, Institute participants will have the opportunity to sign up for the craft sessions that interest them the most.</p>

            <section id="Reading Series">
                <h3 class="header">Reading Series</h3><br>
                <p>The 2017 Juniper Institute Reading Series will be finalized and posted on the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/institute/reading">Juniper website</a> in early spring. Readings are free for participants enrolled in the Institute. Readings begin at 7:30 p.m. and are typically held in the Integrated Sciences Building at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a convenient, air-conditioned and wheelchair accessible venue.</p>

            <section id="Individual Manuscript Consultation">
                <h3 class="header">Individual Manuscript Consultation</h3><br>
                <p>
                    All participants receive detailed attention to their writing in workshops. However, for those interested in private feedback on a longer selection of writing, a limited number of one-on-one manuscript consultations are available for a fee of $150.00. If you choose to have a consultation, a faculty member or writer in residence in your genre will read a selection of your work before the Institute begins, then meet with you for approximately one hour during the Institute to discuss it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manuscript consultations are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. You may indicate your preference for the writer you would like to meet with, but final assignments will be made depending upon scheduling and availability. You may sign up for a manuscript consultation when you enroll.

            <section id="Academic Credit">
                <h3 class="header">Undergraduate/Graduate Academic Credit</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Participants may earn three undergraduate or graduate credits by participating in all Institute activities, reading two genre-specific books by Institute faculty or writers in residence prior to the Institute, and writing two 2-3 page papers responding to those books. Papers are due the week before the Institute. The total cost for 3 credits is $400.00. To register, you will pay a $55.00 registration fee when you enroll in the Institute. The remaining $345.00 will be billed to you directly from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Bursar's Office at the end of the summer. Additional information will be sent to all participants at the time of enrollment.

There are many local retailers accessible by car or bus if you need anything during your stay here.

            <p>
                We encourage homeschooled students to apply to JIYW! A recommendation should come from someone who knows the young writer’s work, their level of interest in discussion, and how they could add to a writing community like Juniper. In your recommendation letter, please speak to the following qualities in your young writer: maturity, interpersonal and collaborative skills, ability to participate in the classroom, ability to adapt to a residential learning environment, and enthusiasm for creative writing. We are interested to hear about how they might learn from and contribute to a diverse, engaged community of young writers living together and gaining a preview of college life.
