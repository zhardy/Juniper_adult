                <h3>Workshops</h3>
                <p>
                	Daily writing workshops are at the heart of the Juniper Institute. Here, writers generate new work and present that work, or other work-in-progress, to their assigned faculty workshop leaders and peers. Workshop sizes are kept small so that every writer's work gets dedicated attention. In addition to focusing on specific pieces of writing, writers actively interrogate larger issues of form, style, content, language, and process.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Every workshop has its own climate and conventions: some lean toward the generation of new work, some toward the honing of existing pieces, and others emphasize a combination of both. While details are subject to revision, <a href="http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/institute/workshops">click here</a> to learn more about how the 2017 faculty describe their approach to their Juniper workshops. Workshop assignments are made in early May. We will be in touch with you in mid-May with instructions concerning anything you need to send in advance or bring with you to your assigned workshop.

                <h3>Craft Sessions and Q&amp;As</h3><br>
                <p>
                	Daily interactive craft sessions and Q&amp;As allow faculty and writers in residence to interact with participants and explore issues pertinent to writing and the writing life, or to lead writing exercises. Three sessions will be devoted to moderated Q&amp;As with select faculty members and writers in residence, offering rare opportunities to discuss process, inspiration, and craft with master writers. On other days, multiple craft sessions or small-group Q&amp;As will run simultaneously with faculty and writers in residence. These sessions will tackle diverse issues of craft and imagination, with an emphasis on guided writing exercises to generate new material. In the spring, Institute participants will have the opportunity to sign up for the craft sessions that interest them the most.

                <h3>Reading Series</h3>
                <p>
                	The 2017 Juniper Institute Reading Series will be finalized and posted on the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/juniperinstitute/#/institute/reading">Juniper website</a> in early spring. Readings are free for participants enrolled in the Institute. Readings begin at 7:30 p.m. and are typically held in the Integrated Sciences Building at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a convenient, air-conditioned and wheelchair accessible venue.

                <h3>Individual Manuscript Consultation</h3>
                <p>
                    All participants receive detailed attention to their writing in workshops. However, for those interested in private feedback on a longer selection of writing, a limited number of one-on-one manuscript consultations are available for a fee of $150.00. If you choose to have a consultation, a faculty member or writer in residence in your genre will read a selection of your work before the Institute begins, then meet with you for approximately one hour during the Institute to discuss it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manuscript consultations are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. You may indicate your preference for the writer you would like to meet with, but final assignments will be made depending upon scheduling and availability. You may sign up for a manuscript consultation when you enroll.

                <p>
                    Participants may earn three undergraduate or graduate credits by participating in all Institute activities, reading two genre-specific books by Institute faculty or writers in residence prior to the Institute, and writing two 2-3 page papers responding to those books. Papers are due the week before the Institute. The total cost for 3 credits is $400.00. To register, you will pay a $55.00 registration fee when you enroll in the Institute. The remaining $345.00 will be billed to you directly from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Bursar's Office at the end of the summer. Additional information will be sent to all participants at the time of enrollment.

                    New England weather is beautiful and unpredictable. June can range from quite warm (80s to 90s) to chilly (50s), and can be rainy, so we suggest keeping an eye on the area's forecast as June approaches. There are many local retailers accessible by car or bus if you need anything during your stay here.

			<section id="Traveling by Plane" class="no-padding">
				<h3>Traveling by Plane</h3>
				<p>
					If you are traveling to Amherst by plane, the closest airport is Bradley International Airport, located in Windsor Locks, Connecticut (right outside of Hartford). This airport is approximately 45 miles south of the UMass campus. Oftentimes visitors find more flight options to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. Logan is approximately 90 miles east of the UMass campus, so if you book a flight to Logan please allow for extra travel time to UMass. Both airports feature car rental agencies and a variety of shuttle services, including <a href="http://www.valleytransporter.com/">Valley Transporter</a> (413-253-1350), <a href="http://www.seemoshuttle.com/">Seemo Shuttle</a> (413-586-1120), Exclusive Car Service (877-695-4665), Bluebird Transportation (413-221-4512), and Michael's Limousine &amp; Transportation Service (413-583-6392).

				<h3>Traveling by Bus</h3>
				<p>
					The Amherst area is serviced by <a href="http://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a>, <a href="http://peterpanbus.com/">Peter Pan Bus Lines</a>, <a href="http://megabus.com/">Megabus</a> and the <a href="http://www.pvta.com/">Pioneer Valley Transit Authority</a> (PVTA).
				</p>
				<p>
					For Greyhound, Peter Pan, and Megabus, we recommend using "Amherst UMass, MA" as your destination (not "Amherst Center, MA"). The Amherst UMass stop will bring you right to Haigis Mall, located on the UMass Campus. From here, the UMass Campus Center is about a 7 minute walk and the North Apartments are about a 15 minute walk.
				</p>
				<p>
					For PVTA buses, we recommend taking a look at the various routes and schedules available on the <a href="http://pvta.com/">PVTA</a> website. You may also want to use the PVTA <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Northampton,+MA/Holyoke,+MA/@42.2646536,-72.6911739,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e6d73e7c8e2a05:0xc316750b13d8db0b!2m2!1d-72.6412013!2d42.3250896!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e6dec832f646a7:0x650750c4f311939b!2m2!1d-72.6162009!2d42.2042586!3e3?hl=en">Google Trip Planner</a>, <a href="http://bustracker.pvta.com/InfoPoint">Where's My Bus?</a>, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mystop-mobile/id591959423?mt=8">PVTA Bus Tracker App</a> to help you plan the best route for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please be sure to carefully review bus schedules, bus stop locations, and <a href="http://www.umass.edu/visitorsctr/campusmaps">campus maps</a> prior to your arrival - not only do many bus services run on a reduced schedule in the summer, but both the area and the campus can be confusing to navigate if it is your first time here. If you need any assistance planning your trip, please let us know!

				<h3>Traveling by Train</h3>
				<p>
					Amtrak provides passenger rail service to nearby Northampton, MA, located a 20 minute drive from the UMass campus, and Springfield, MA, located a 30 minute drive from the UMass campus. For schedule information and to purchase tickets, visit <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/home">Amtrak's website</a> and select "Northampton, MA (NHT)" or "Springfield, MA (SPG)" as your arrival destination.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you take a train to Northampton, MA, you will need to take a bus or taxi to the UMass campus. Both <a href="http://www.pvta.com/">PVTA</a> and <a href="http://peterpanbus.com/">Peter Pan</a> buses service the area, with bus stops about a 7 minute walk from the platform. You may use one of the many <a href="http://www.northamptonma.gov/172/Taxi-Services">local taxi services</a>. We encourage you to carefully plan your trip, including bus or taxi services, prior to your arrival: the Northampton train platform is not a train station and phone access, area maps, bus schedules, and bus tickets will not be available once you arrive. The train platform is located at 170 Pleasant Street in Northampton, MA.
				</p>


				<p>
					If you take a train to Springfield, MA, we recommend booking a shuttle service, such as <a href="http://www.valleytransporter.com/">Valley Transporter</a>, to get you from the Springfield station building to UMass. Bus services, including <a href="http://peterpanbus.com/">Peter Pan</a>, are also available, but will require about a 15 minute walk from the train station to the bus stop. The train will arrive at the Springfield station building, located at 66 Lyman Street in Springfield, MA. This station building does have a waiting room, ticket office, quik-trak kiosk, and payphone, but we do still encourage you to plan your trip, including services from the train station to campus, prior to your arrival.

Attendees with a valid state-issued reserved accessible license plate or placard may park in any marked Handicap Space or any nonrestricted, nonreserved space or lot, at no charge, as long as your plate or placard is clearly displayed at all times during your stay. To locate reserved accessible parking, visit the <a href="http://umts.github.io/ParkingMap/">UMass Parking Map</a>, select the blue parking icon on the right, and click the "Handicapped Parking" option.
				</p>
				<p>
					You should not park at UMass without first obtaining a valid permit as detailed above: parking on campus without a valid permit, pass, placard, or license plate will result in ticketing and/or towing.

				<h3>Getting Around Campus &amp; the Area</h3>
				<p>
					The Institute has workshops, readings, and events in a variety of buildings around campus, all within a roughly 5-10 minute walk. If you are concerned about walking around campus throughout the week to get to the various Institute buildings, or if you have any accessibility requirements, please indicate such on the enrollment page. We will follow up with you after processing and reviewing your enrollment. In the meantime, you may want to take a look at information provided by <a href="http://www.umass.edu/transportation/special-transportation">UMass Special Transportation Services</a> to see if any of these services would be beneficial to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are multiple transportation options to get you from campus to amenities and attractions in the surrounding area. Amherst center, with local shops, restaurants, and small convenience stores, is a quick 10-15 minute walk from campus. Local buses, operated by the <a href="http://www.pvta.com/">Pioneer Valley Transit Authority</a>, run regularly between Amherst center and the University, with additional services traveling throughout the Pioneer Valley, including Northampton, Springfield, and Greenfield. If you'd rather take a car, UMass has partnered with <a href="http://www.umass.edu/transportation/car-share">Zipcar</a> to bring on-demand car sharing services right to campus. If you find you need to visit a grocery store, large retail store, or pharmacy during your stay, numerous options are located on University Drive and Russell Street (also known as Route 9) in neighboring Hadley, a 5-10 minute drive from campus by car or bus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note: to simplify your visit, we recommend that you choose a housing option on or close to campus if you are not bringing a car to the Institute.
