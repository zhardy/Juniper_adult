        <p>All participants receive detailed attention to their writing in workshop. For those interested, a limited number of private manuscript consultations with faculty or writers in residence are available for a fee of $150. Participants meet privately with their assigned consultant for 60 minutes to receive concentrated feedback on a longer manuscript than what might be presented in workshop (up to 20 pages of poetry, 35 pages of prose).</p>

            With ties to writers like Robert Frost, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Sylvia Plath, and W. E. B. Dubois, New England has one of the country’s richest literary traditions. Amherst’s most famous author might be Emily Dickinson, whose homestead draws visitors from all over the world. Juniper participants who visit the Emily Dickinson House frequently report experiencing a profound connection to the area’s literary heritage. Amherst and Northampton are also home to The Eric Carle Museum, the Yiddish Book Center, and a host of restaurants, independent bookstores, cinemas, and are driving distance from the neighboring Berkshires.
