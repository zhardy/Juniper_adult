							description: "In here we'll worry the nuts and bolts of fiction&ndash;the mechanical aspects&ndash;but we'll also try to engage the magic and the sweep of fiction. The goal is always to pay the reader back for the time they're investing in your words. Make them laugh, let them cry, take away their sleep or tell them they're not as alone as they might think. And don't shy away from the fantastic, from the genres. The only things you should shy away from are muddied narrative, turgid prose, and ever being timid on the page. Dare to make a fool of yourself. Dare to be naked in the story. Write what you don't think you can write. Otherwise, you'll never get anywhere interesting."

							description: "Participants&apos; new, raw material will provide the basis for this workshop. We will be working on three to four stories per session; the last session will be devoted to individual manuscript consultation (number of participants permitting). In addition to working with participant&apos;s manuscripts, we&apos;ll also be discussing some (more or less, classic or strange) stories to explore the techniques to make them effective."

							description: "In our workshop, we will explore what a poem is, what it can do, and what it will do, especially to you, and what it can and will do to your readers. We will examine your own poems closely in order to consider larger issues of craft and poetics. You will be asked constantly to re-imagine what your poems can become and it is the hope of the workshop that you will see your work transformed by the end of our time together. Writing exercises will be shared with you in order to aid this transformation and to push your practice, particularly those which ask you to engage with the everyday and the beauty of objects, things, and people. You will also be urged to share with the group: ideas, poems, songs, paintings, cities, crystals, animals, colors, theories, small jars filled with lead, heroes and heroines, gods and goddesses, disciplines, famous people and family members, foods, and flowers that inspire you and to create your own poetry exercises that help us all to see poetry anew. In doing all of this work, we will begin to create poems that are \"Music to sleep in,\" as Jack Spicer might have or might still urge us to do."

							writer:"Dara Wier",
							type:"Poetry",
							description:"In our workshop you'll be invited to bring us your most questionable poems, your almost there poems, your inklings of poems, your most difficult (especially to you) poems, your poems in progress, your poems done and finished, complete and mysterious.  (whether this be in poem or in prose) And with them your concerns, risk-taking questions, gut feelings, risks, and instincts, your experience as a writer and as a reader, and your understanding of why poems matter, to you, and anyone. You'll be invited to bring us poems by poets you admire so we can gain a collective reading experience we can talk about, refer to, and enjoy. You'll be given a chance if you chose it,  to tell us how you happen to come to be writing poetry and what you hope your poetry will be up to.  You'll be invited to ask questions, tell us things, direct our conversation toward subjects you feel significant to poets gathering over poetry, in order to love it, to question it and to further its life in the future. Your work is the heart and soul and brain of our meetings and it will be our main focus."

							writer: "Noy Holland",

							description: "Our time here is short and happily intense. I think you will use it best and hardest by producing new work while you are here, by internalizing&mdash;through the act of writing&mdash;the varied lessons that arise among us. My idea is to approach the work in units. We might spend a whole workshop, for instance, looking at adjectives and adverbs; another workshop looking at dialogue; another at the angle of perception; another at rhythm and syntax. After each workshop, I ask that you embrace what you&#8216;ve discovered by producing work that responds to those discoveries&mdash;in direct and meaningful and immediate ways."
