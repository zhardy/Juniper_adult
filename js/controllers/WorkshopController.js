							description: "Meeting god or dog or something in memoir. The idea of this workshop is to join conventional or unconventional memoir w\/fantasy or god or whatever non-right brain realm you\'d like to dwell in. I supposed if you want to join convention w convention I\'d say let\'s look at the joint. How in prose do we continue. What is prose. I\'m particularly interested in working w poets moving into prose. Momentum and flow being the subject then. The primary goals here will be to think more broadly about what the elements of your imagined vehicle could be, write at least one of those chapters in the time of the workshop and generally be more fearless about what sorts of reading materials go next to each other in a work of nonfiction. So it\'s a week of mapping and writing that we will be about."

							type:"Poetry Workshop",
							description: "In our workshop, we will explore what a poem is, what it can do, and what it will do, especially to you, and what it can and will do to your readers. We will examine your own poems closely in order to consider larger issues of craft and poetics. You will be asked constantly to re-imagine what your poems can become and it is the hope of the workshop that you will see your work transformed by the end of our time together. Writing exercises will be shared with you in order to aid this transformation and to push your practice, particularly those which ask you to engage with the everyday and the beauty of objects, things, and people. You will also be urged to share with the group: ideas, poems, songs, paintings, cities, crystals, animals, colors, theories, small jars filled with lead, heroes and heroines, gods and goddesses, disciplines, famous people and family members, foods, and flowers that inspire you and to create your own poetry exercises that help us all to see poetry anew. In doing all of this work, we will begin to create poems that are \"Music to sleep in,\" as Jack Spicer might have or might still urge us to do."

							description: "Sense, the Sentence, and Syntax: This workshop studies the relationship between the various ways a poem offers or constructs meaning &mdash; that is, \"makes sense\" &mdash; and the tactics it uses to literally embody that meaning, via the line, sentence and verbs. About this \"making sense,\" we'll consider it in at least three ways: first, as any of those deliberate moments commonly called the image that gesture, relate to or otherwise awaken the body's five senses; second, as that overall moving, if transforming, logic or \"sense\" of identity or argument that drives the poem; and, lastly, as sensibility, not just the poem&rsquo;s atmosphere, tone or stylistic tics but the poet's as well. Along with each, we&rsquo;ll labor to see specifically how syntax (sentence structure, length, deployment, verbiage, meter and more) underwrites, enacts or, even, subverts or queers what sense is available in the poem. In short, we'll reveal, if not collapse, that ground which sits between \"content\" (subjectivity) and \"form\" (body) in both our own work and the work of a selection of published poets."

							writer:"Dara Wier",
							type:"Poetry Workshop",
							description:"In our workshop you'll be invited to bring us your most questionable poems, your almost there poems, your inklings of poems, your most difficult (especially to you) poems, your poems in progress, your poems done and finished, complete and mysterious.  (whether this be in poem or in prose) And with them your concerns, risk-taking questions, gut feelings, risks, and instincts, your experience as a writer and as a reader, and your understanding of why poems matter, to you, and anyone. You'll be invited to bring us poems by poets you admire so we can gain a collective reading experience we can talk about, refer to, and enjoy. You'll be given a chance if you chose it,  to tell us how you happen to come to be writing poetry and what you hope your poetry will be up to.  You'll be invited to ask questions, tell us things, direct our conversation toward subjects you feel significant to poets gathering over poetry, in order to love it, to question it and to further its life in the future. Your work is the heart and soul and brain of our meetings and it will be our main focus."

							writer: "Bianca Stone",
							type:"Words & Pictures",
							description: "In this class we will focus on exploring who we are as both literary and visual artists through our obsessions and the Ekphrastic form. Drawing from traditional and nontraditional essentials, we will produce new poems/poetry comics/hybrid works inspired by visual art, and explore the possibilities in combining words and pictures together. No visual art experience necessary!"

							writer: "Camille Rankine",
							type: "Literary Arts + Action",
							description: "Can speech constitute action? Can language be a catalyst for change? In this workshop we will examine the ways in which the work of writing can be a space of political action and social engagement. Through reading and classroom discussion, we'll investigate ideas of literary activism, and consider what responsibilities a writer may or may not have to their communities, and to address issues like injustice, inequality, violence, and the pressing concerns of our society today. We'll discuss the methods poetry and prose writers use to respond to political and social issues through various uses of form, voice, sound and syntax to create a stirring landscape that inspires, chills, and provokes. Students will generate new work as we chart a course through this landscape, and will be encouraged to explore poetry, essay, fiction or hybrid forms in their writing."

							writer: "Noy Holland",
							type: "Fiction Workshop",
							description: "Our time here is short and happily intense. I think you will use it best and hardest by producing new work while you are here, by internalizing&mdash;through the act of writing&mdash;the varied lessons that arise among us. My idea is to approach the work in units. We might spend a whole workshop, for instance, looking at adjectives and adverbs; another workshop looking at dialogue; another at the angle of perception; another at rhythm and syntax. After each workshop, I ask that you embrace what you&#8216;ve discovered by producing work that responds to those discoveries&mdash;in direct and meaningful and immediate ways."

							writer:"Mitchell S. Jackson",
							type:"Fiction Workshop",
							description:"In this Fiction workshop, we will work to deepen your understanding of the elements of fiction including voice, point of view, setting, characterization, pacing, tone, plot development, dialogue, etc. We also aspire to improve the skills necessary to critique the work of others. We will workshop a few stories per session and also will complete writing exercises to assist in exploring a range of strategies, impulses, and ideas. We will also discuss considerations for revision."

							description: "Participants&apos; new, raw material will provide the basis for this workshop. We will be working on three to four stories per session; the last session will be devoted to individual manuscript consultation (number of participants permitting). In addition to working with participant&apos;s manuscripts, we&apos;ll also be discussing some (more or less, classic or strange) stories to explore the techniques to make them effective."
